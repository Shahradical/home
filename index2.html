    <h3>Ecology</h3>
    <p>The willow is a tree that mainly grows in the northern hemisphere	&#44; consisting
      of 400 different species of deciduous trees and bushes. A species of Willow known
      as the &lsquo;Weeping Willow&rsquo; is the most interesting in the genus salix	&#44;
      being named after its droopy demeanor	&#44; reminscent of someone weeping. The name 
      Willow has unknown origins	&#44; but it is theorized that the name of the genus Salix 
      comes from ancient Celtic	&#44; meaning &lsquo;near water&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <h3>Uses and Facts</h3>
    <p>The willow tree has one of the most important functions of a tree. The bark 
     has special medicinal properties	&#44; mainly its painkiller properties. The chemical
     that it contains in its bark	&#44; salicylate	&#44; can be turned into salicylic acid. The 
     tree is very loosely connected to the creation of Aspirin	&#44; a well-known painkiller.
     Many of the trees parts are edible	&#44; such as the leaves	&#44; roots	&#44;	 and the inner layers of 
     its bark.

    <h3>Ecology</h3>
    <p>The Baobab tree is a large deciduous tree in the genus Adansonia. They can be found in
      in Most of Africa and Australia. They can flower and usually have a very distinct scent 
      and can be very large. The dry and hot habitat means that these flowers aren't very long 
      lived	&#44; and will die after their use in the short reproductive phase of the tree. The tree's
      thick and wide trunk is used to store large amounts of water.
    </p>
    <h3> Uses and Facts</h3>
    <p> The trees drop very nutritious fruits and the leaves contain many nutrients as well.
      They are extremely fibrous and can have more calcium than milk and massive amounts of
      vitamin C comparable to oranges. It also contains a large amount of antioxidants&#44; which 
      can help prevent cancer by neutralizing carcinogens. The fruit can also only be produced 
      if the flower is pollinated by a bat.

    <h3>Ecology</h3>
   <p>The Ginkgo tree is a tree that originates in China. It is part of the species Ginkgoales
     which has been around for 300 million years and is one of the last surviving members remaining.
     The name &lsquo;Ginkgo&rsquo; is originally from Japanese but is misspelt in English and Chinese&#44; 
     meaning &lsquo;Silver Apricot&rsquo;.
   </p>
    <h3>Uses and Facts</h3>
    <p>
    The leaves of the ginkgo tree are one of the most unique and well recognized. They are shaped
    similairly to a fan and turn to a beautiful shade of gold during Autumn. The large span of 
    time the Ginkgo tree has existed has created a very complex genome for it&#44; sequencing finding
    10 billion genes. There is ongoing research of if Ginkgo can prevent age-related ailments 
    and even aging.
